			<h2>Urban Mining in San Marcos, TX</h2>
			<h3>September 2018</h3>
			<p>
				Urban Mining in San Marcos, TX is a fully integrated facility producing and manufacturing magnets. The plant consists of four 2000kVA Utility Transformers powering 4 independent switchboards via Transfer Switches. The emergency side of the Transfer Switches are connected to a Standby Generator Switchboard capable of powering the plant via the standby generator switchboard. MTX working in conjunction with Hill Country Electric in San Antonio was able to supply the following to MEG of the Austin Office which is the main GC for the plant.
